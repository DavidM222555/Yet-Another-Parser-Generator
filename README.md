# Yet-Another-Tokenizer-Generator
This project is my attempt at, first, creating a tokenizer and from there I hope to then integrate it with a parser. Effectively, I'm trying to replicate 
the famous programming language creation program Flex and Bison.

Currently I have implemented the basics for user generated patterns for lexemes and the generation of NFAs for recognizing tokens that fit those regex patterns.
